This is a simple VB.Net program that saves any images that are set into the clipboard to a specified file.

The main usage for this program is when you press the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> button. Windows copies the screen to the clipboard as an image, but it doesn't save it to a file. On Windows 8 you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Print Screen</kbd>, but if you wanted to do that in Windows 7 and possibly Windows XP/Vista you might have to use this program. Plus, this program gives flexibility of where to save the images and what they are named, whereas on Windows 8 they are saved with a default timestamp format into the pictures library.

This program gives functionality of the screenshot function on a mobile device. On a mobile device, as soon as you [press the screenshot combination](http://matthewcstech.blogspot.com/2013/10/how-to-screenshot-on-your-mobile-device.html), it saves an image to your device's storage. On Windows 8, as mentioned above this behaviour is implemented, you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> to take a screenshot and save it to your Images library, but if you want that behaviour on Windows 7 or earlier this program, combined with the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> button, gives a PC that functionality.
